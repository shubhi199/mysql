Application programming interfaces
Many programming languages with language-specific APIs include libraries for accessing MySQL databases.
 These include MySQL Connector/Net for integration with Microsoft's Visual Studio (languages such as C# and VB are most commonly
 used)  and the JDBC driver for Java.
  In addition, an ODBC interface called MySQL Connector/ODBC allows additional programming languages that support the ODBC 
  interface to communicate with a MySQL database, such as ASP or ColdFusion.
  The HTSQL â€“ URL-based query method also ships with a MySQL adapter, allowing direct interaction between a MySQL database and 
  any web client via structured URLs.
